Hi, i hav strong suspicion that evm contract conditions are not implemented for lit actions, the decryptAndCombine function specifically.

In main.ts you can uncomment various functions to see what i am trying to achieve, and what works or doesn't work.

npm i and then npm run start
youl'll also need the .env. I can send those over. Its all testnet, but i dont want git guardian to get mad at me. 

Any help would be appreciated. If you can confirm it is not implemented yet, could you tell me if its on the roadmap?
